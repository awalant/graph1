                <p>
                    The uniform perception of sex education in the United States typically involves the cliché imagery of awkward, pimply teens and pre-teens spending their class time practicing putting condoms on bananas. [1] However, American education regarding sexual health and wellness is anything but uniform. </p>
                <p>The standards around what is to be taught in school varies in every way, shifting in quality and guidelines from state to state, district to district, curricula to curricula. [2] These inconsistencies have a lasting impact on American youth, and result in detrimental long-term personal and public health effects. [3] In order to have a positive impact on the current standards (and lack-there-of), it is important to understand the current status of sex education in the United States.

            <h2>The varying laws around sex education</h2>
            <p id="noIndent">

                Currently, sex education – unlike science, history, and even gym class – has no centralized standards that define the topics that schools must cover or the learning outcomes that students must exhibit in order to be deemed proficient. The topic of sexual health and wellness as a whole has been left to the determination of individual states, and in some states is left to the individual districts. [2]
            </p>
            <p>
                A note: some states have began making moves towards reforming their laws pertaining to sexual health and wellness, particularly as it relates to consent, but the following data is from April 1, 2019. Any updates made after this date are not reflected here.

                    The lack of unity in sex education has lasting impacts on children. The varying information, definitions, and amounts of shame given to children during these courses (if these courses are offered at all) can contribute towards different negative side effects: the repression of sexual and gender identity expression [5], the miscommunication in sexual encounters that can result in sexual assault [6], the misinformation that leads to positive pregnancy and STI test results [7].

They include current students graduating high school, recent graduates of high school and college, and educators. Additionally, those interviewed are people with an assortment of educational histories share their experiences, reflecting on how it impacted their sexual decisions and identities before, during, and after college.

                    The experiences of these individuals differ because of the laws in their states, and whether or not others became involved with their sexual health and wellness education (such as parents, siblings, friends, or social media personalities). It’s understandable that studies have had a hard time understanding the impact of sex education in the United States as a whole. [8]</p>
                <p>

                    It is also understandable that then, once in a college setting, students are witnessing and experiencing an “epidemic” of sexual assault. [9] On campus, students from all districts, states, and countries melt together, without parental guidance and with the influx of substances such as alcohol and drugs. The understanding of the topics that would be covered in a comprehensive sex education course vary widely from person to person, leading to different interpretations and implementations of the same concepts. In practice, this can contribute towards miscommunications that result in sexual assault, albeit unintentionally. [10]

                    Researchers looking into the risk factors associated with being both a victim and perpetrator of sexual assault attempted to ascertain a link between sex education and sexual assault. [8] Their results in this particular arena were inconclusive, except to say that students who were taught "refusal skills" as part of a comprehensive curriculum had the ability to say no or negotiate for activities they were more comfortable with, and were less likely to become victims of sexual assault on campus.</p>


                <p>While in this case the small preventative link between sex ed and sexual assault is a beneficial one, the researchers were unable to find a more apparent connection. They attributed this failure to find a quantifiable impact of sex ed on the quality of sex education that students recieved. The lessons learned varied so widely from student to student.

                    There are multiple levels at which change can occur.

                <p>
                    First and foremost, change has to occur in the home. [12] National surveys show that between educations received both at school and at home, only 16% of high school aged students reported having ever discussed sexual assault. [13] Education regarding consent, healthy relationships, and can start at any age, and it's important to have those lessons and discussions positively reinforced at home.

                <p>
                    Additionally, change has to occur at schools. It must first be established what kind of information is currently being taught in schools. [12] Even in states or districts where certain material is mandated, it does not actually ensure the topic is covered. These insights could be gleaned from a variety of sources, including but not limited to: current students, program supervisors or teachers, administrators, and at school board meetings. It is recommended that at a minimum, schools cover "anatomy and physiology, puberty and adolescent development,
                    pregnancy and reproduction, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV,
                    healthy relationships, personal safety." [12]

                <h4> At the capitol</h4>
                <p>
                    Finally, change must occur in the government. [12] By reaching out to local and state representatives, constituents can stress the importance of the material that should be covered in school, and why. Having laws in place that require content to be covered can help to protect teachers from parental litigation, and [in theory] means the schools have to comply with the regulations.

            For more information about about sex education in the United States, the books "Girls and Sex" by Peggy Orenstein, and "Too Hot to Handle" by Jonathan Zimmerman are excellent resources. Orenstein's book gives an excellent look into the lives of teenaged girls and young women and how culture and education has impacted their experiences, good and bad. Zimmerman's book provdes a history of sex education around the world and helped me understand that perhaps our European educational role models aren't excellent role models afterall.
