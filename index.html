                <h3>An introduction to American sex education</h3>
                <p>
                    The history of sex education in the United States is a lot more progressive than one might imagine. In the early years of the American public school system, sex education was taught in a fairly comprehensive matter. Throughout times of war, the topic was covered in schools mostly to guard against soldiers picking up sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) and prostitutes while overseas. After the war, the attitude towards sex education changed more towards family planning, and placed more of an emphasis on gender roles. This spurred a strong counter-culture reaction in the 60’s and 70’s that pushed individuals to discover themselves and their sexualities. It wasn’t until the 1980’s and the explosion of the AIDS crisis that the tone of sex education in the united states changed, and it was pushed towards a staunch and religious model of abstinent until marriage, also known as the abstinence-only education model.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nowadays, sex education, unlike science, history, and even gym class, has no centralized standards that define the topics that schools must cover or the learning outcomes that students must exhibit in order to be deemed proficient. The topic of sexual health and wellness as a whole has been left to the determination of individual states, and in some states is left to the individual districts. The most comprehensive sex education laws at this point come from California, where they require the teaching of consent in schools, and mandate that schools must provide age appropriate, medically accurate, and culturally unbiased information on sex and HIV. Meanwhile, Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wyoming currently have no state laws and leave it to their individual districts to decide what to teach in school. The rest of the states lie somewhere in between.

                    The various curricula implemented state to state, and even district to district, have varying effects on the students in those schools. The state laws, in combination with personal factors such as religious intervention or parental/sibling guidance, contribute towards the future experiences of these young, developing adults.

                    To get a better understanding of the impact these factors have and had on the thoughts and experiences of children nationwide, here are some select quotes from conversations with individuals ages 19–32. They include current students graduating high school, recent graduates of high school and college, and educators. Additionally, people with an assortment of educational histories share their experiences, reflecting on how it impacted their decisions made before, during, and after college.

                    The experiences of these individuals differ because of the laws in their states, and whether or not others became involved with their sexual health and wellness education. It’s understandable that studies have had a hard time understanding the impact of sex education in the United States as a whole.</p>
                <p>

                    It is also understandable that then, once in a college setting, there has been an “epidemic” of sexual assault. Once on campus, students from all districts, states, and countries melt together, without parental guidance and with the influx of substances such as alcohol and drugs. The understanding of the topics that would be covered in a comprehensive sex education course vary widely from person to person, leading to different interpretations and implementations of the same concepts.

                    The result of the mixed messaging given to children has proven to be confusing at best, and ineffective at its worst. In a perfect world, all students (and all adults, for that matter) would be able to properly define sexual assault and consent so they may be more aware of when it is happening to them, or recognize when they are making someone uncomfortable.

                </p>

                <p>Although the average rates of teenaged pregnancies are down, experts say that this has more to do with technology and helicopter parents than any method of sex education, abstinence or otherwise. (Abstinence education has actually proven to be completely ineffective with reducing the rates of teenaged jdiuhsgyadhjsadsa). However, STDs continue to spread among teens, college campuses have become rife with sexual assault to the extent that it's been labeled as an epidemic, and the world is still reverberating with the effects of the #MeToo movement.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Researchers looking into the risk factors associated with being both a victim and perpetrator of sexual assault attempted to ascertain a link between sex education and sexual assault. Their results in this particular arena were inconclusive, except to say that students who were taught "refusal skills," the ability to say no or negotiate for activities they are more comfortable with, were less likely to become victims of sexual assault on campus. Students who were in programs that taught more comprehensive sex education were more likely to receive this education.</p>


                <p>While in this case the small preventative link between sex ed and sexual assault is great, the fact that the researchers were unable to find a more apparent connection is unsettling. They attributed this failure to find the impact of sex ed on the fact that the quality of sex education students recieved had varied so widely from student to student.

                <h3>Improving sex ed</h3>
                <p>
                    How does the state of sex education improve? The laws and legislations regarding teaching sexual health and wellness have room to get better. However, even if all the states were to adopt progressive laws like California's, kids would still be exempt from these classes as they are in California which arguably makes sense from the standpoint of religion. That said, as noted above in the quotes by a high school teacher in a state with mandatory sex education, students aren't necessarily taught it. 


                </p>
                <p>
                Some of this inevitably has to do with the wording and phrasing of these programs and classes. Often, the subject of sex education is meant to be covered in classes like "life skills" or "health." However, by omitting the word "sex" from these course titles, districts, schools, and teachers are able to skate around having to include an uncomfortable topic in their curriculum. However, even places like Sweden, which is often noted as having an enviable sex ed program, the teachers often avoid the subject and cite that their discomfort with the subject is the reason.
                
                </p>
                
                <p>
                While students spend time learning SAT vocabulary words and memorizing historical dates for AP exams, this knowledge will serve them a temporary purpose. Sex education, inevitably, will serve them for life. Even if students intend to abstain until marriage, knowing about sexual health and wellness will prepare them for when they begin being sexually active. Regardless of whether the topic is covered in school, children have been learning less and less about sex ed at home, and inevitably turn to their peers, social media, and pornography to learn about the topics that their parents won't discuss with them. Ultimately, it is up to the schools and the parents to determine what they want their children to know, to vote and advocate for these lessons to be taught in schools, and to discuss it at home with their children.

            If you'd like to learn more about sex education in the United States, I highly recommend the books "Girls and Sex" by Peggy Orenstein, and "Too Hot to Handle" by Jonathan Zimmerman. Orenstein's book gives an excellent look into the lives of teenaged girls and young women and how culture and education has impacted their experiences, good and bad. Zimmerman's book provdes a history of sex education around the world and helped me understand that perhaps our European educational role models aren't excellent role models afterall.
